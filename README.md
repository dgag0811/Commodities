**Repository Overview**
The primary focus of this repository is to explore pair value strategies in the commodities market. Pair value strategies involve trading two correlated commodities, taking long positions in one and short positions in the other based on their relative price movements. This approach attempts to capitalize on deviations from their historical price correlation, betting that the relationship will revert to its mean over time.

This repository also delves into Commodity Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which allow for efficient, liquid, and diversified exposure to the commodities sector. Commodities ETFs provide investors an easy way to track the price movements of individual commodities or baskets of commodities.

Pair Value Strategy in Commodities
We will analyze the historical relationships between commodity pairs such as:
Soybean and Corn

The goal is to develop strategies that can exploit price dislocations and predict mean reversion in these relationships.

USO (United States Oil Fund)

These ETFs provide exposure to individual commodities or a diversified basket, which can serve as a hedge, a trading tool, or a long-term investment vehicle.
Statistical Analysis & Backtesting
Various Python-based statistical tools, including cointegration tests, correlation analysis, and mean-reversion models, will be employed to backtest the effectiveness of the pair value strategies.
